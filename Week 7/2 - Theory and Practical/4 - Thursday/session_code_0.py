# Common Character sets

"""
ASCII - American Standard COde for Information Interchange
Unicode - Universal Character encoding
UTF-8 - Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit
"""

"""
1. ASCII
- 128 characters that include english letters, numerals and symbols
- basic and common for english language but not for non-english characters
"""

"""
2. Unicode
- universal character encoding standard that represents most if not all characters
from known languages and scripts
"""

"""
3. UTF-8 
- Variable width character encoding that represents using 8-bit code units
- widely used and efficiently handles english and non-english characters

# Why Encoding
"""
1. Multilingual Suport
2. Avoiding data corruption
3. Handling special characters - ü¶æüéâ
"""


# Best Practices for file handling 
"""
1. Use with() context manager
2. Specify encoding - when working with files.
3. Handle Exceptions (try/catch)
4. Avoid hardcoding file paths (os library)
5. Use correct file access modes - r, w, a

# 1. Use with() context manager
with open('random_names.txt', 'r+') as file:
    print(file.read())

# 2. Specify encoding - when working with files.

# 4. Avoid hardcoding file paths (os library)

# Approach 1 - use of variable
